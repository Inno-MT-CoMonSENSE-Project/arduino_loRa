# Arduino based end-node sending data over LoRa to LoRaWAN network
This sketch reads sensor's data, encode them to Cayanne LPP format and sends them via LoRa to a LoRaWAN network - [Chirpstack.io](https://www.chirpstack.io/) in a set interval.  It uses OTAA (Over-the-air activation) to join a LoRaWAN network and a set of keys to encrypt the communication between the end-node and Application server.

There are two sketches available:
  - Example: Reads data from [DHT11](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht) temperature and humidity sensor and sends the reading in 
  Cayanne LPP format to Chirpstack.
  - Template: Functionally same as Example, however it is missing the Cayanne LPP encoding for a specific sensors as well as the sensor's data reading function and extra libraries.

## Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA)

This uses OTAA (Over-the-air activation), where where a DevEUI and
application key is configured, which are used in an over-the-air
activation procedure where a DevAddr and session keys are
assigned/generated for use with all further communication.

## Prerequisites
You need to have [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) installed, gateway running, [Chirpstack](https://www.chirpstack.io/) LoRaWAN network set-up and have a device registered on Chirpstack Application Server.

### LMiC library modification
We need need to change the Frequency Band to use with LG01-N. Locate a *config.h* file which path is `...\arduino\libraries\arduino-lmic \src\lmic\config.h.` and open it. Uncomment EU frequency and LG02_LG01 definition:
```C
#define CFG_eu868 1
//#define CFG_us915 1
//#define CFG_au921 1
//#define CFG_as923 1
//#define CFG_in866 1

#define LG02_LG01 1
```
 
### Gateway set-up
We are using [Dragino LG01-N Single Channel Gateway](http://www.dragino.com/products/lora/item/143-lg01n.html), though for a real world implementation, it is not recommended to use Single-channel gateways as they are not LoRaWAN-compliant.

First, set-up the LG01-N wireless connection:
  1. Connect PC to LG01-Nâ€™s LAN port via RJ45 cable. Gateway should be accesible on `10.130.1.1`
  2. Use browser to access the LG01-N via IP `10.130.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin`
  3. For login use *User name: root* and *Password: dragino*.
  4. In Network --> Wireless, select *radio0* interface and select Scan. 
  5. Select the desired Wireless access point, join the wifi network and enter its password.
  6. In Network --> Wireless, Disable the WiFi AP with SSID: *dragino-xxxxxx* (the one on Mode: Master)

Secondly, we need to configure the gateway so that it sends data to the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge component. In Service --> LoRaWan Gateway change the following entries:
  - IoT Service --> *LoRaWan/RAW forwarder*
  - Service Provider --> *--custom--*
  - Server Address --> YOUR SERVER'S IP ADDRESS
  - Server upstream Port --> *1700*
  - Server downstream  Port --> *1700*
  - Frequency (HZ) --> *868100000*
  - Spreading Factor --> *SF7*
  - Coding Rate --> *4/5*
  - Signal Bandwidth --> *125 kHz*

### Chirpstack servers set-up
 To be written in seperate document. For now, follow [this](https://www.chirpstack.io/guides/debian-ubuntu/) set-up.
 
### Set-up on Chirpstack
To successfully receive data by Network and Application server, we need to set-up the configuration for Network server, Service profile, Device profile, Gateway, Application and Device. To access the ChirpStack Application Server web-interface, enter the IP address or hostname of you server, followed by *port 8080* which is a default configuration, e.g. `localhost:8080`. Then for login use *Username: admin* and *Password: admin*. 

#### Network-servers
In order to connect your ChirpStack Application Server instance with the ChirpStack Network Server instance, click Network servers and then *Add*. Fill a name of the Network server, so it is identifiable on the network. As the ChirpStack Network Server is installed on the same host as the ChirpStack Application Server in our case, use `127.0.0.1:8000` as network-server server. Then click Create Network Server.

#### Service-profiles
Click Service profiles and then *Create*. Fill a name for a service profile for easier identification. Pick a Network server you would like to associate with this service profile. Maximum allowed data-rate should be set to 5. Then click Create Service profile.

#### Device-profiles
Click Device profiles and then *Create*. In *General* tab, create a name for a device profile and pick a network server to associate it with. Then set:
  - LoRaWAN MAC version --> *1.0.3*
  - LoRaWAN Regional parameters version --> *B*

In *Join (OTAA/ABP)* tab *Check* Device supports OTAA. In *Codec* tab pick *Cayenne LPP*. Then click Create Device profile.

#### Gateways
Click Gateways and then *Create*. Fill a Gateway name and description. For the Gateway ID you can choose your own (but do not forget to update it on a Gateway itself as well) or access the Gateway through browser on `10.130.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin` (if connected via RJ45 cable). Go to Services --> LoRaWan Gateway and copy the *Gateway ID* from there. Then choose a Network server you would like the gateway to connect to. Then click Create Gateway.

#### Applications
Click Applications and then *Create*. Fill Application name and description. Pick a Service profile to associated the application with. Then click Create Application.
 
#### Devices
Click Applications, pick one of applications from the list and then *Create*. Fill Device name and description. Generate new Device EUI (DEVEUI) or fill your own. Pick a Device profile to associate with a device. Then click Create Device.

Open a device you just created and go to *Keys (OTAA)* tab. Generate new Application key (APPKEY) or fill your own. Then click Set Device-keys.

## Installation
Clone the repository and modify the Template sketch according to your needs. 

For the Example sketch:
  - Connect the sensor's pins to Arduino as follows: 

| DHT 11 Sensor | Arduino Uno |
|---------------|-------------|
| GND           | GND         |
| DAT           | A0          |
| VCC           | 5V          |

  - Download DHT 11 library:
    - Tools --> Manage Libraries --> Search for DHT 11 and install, or
    - Download the [DHT 11 library](https://github.com/goodcheney/Lora/blob/patch-1/Lora%20Shield/Examples/DHTlib.zip). Add the library in Arduino IDE: *Sketch --> Include Library --> Add .ZIP Library...*.
  - Open your Chirpstack application server in a browser (default `localhost:8080`), navigate to *Applications* and pick a desired application from the list.
  - Open the Example sketch and update:
    - *DEVEUI*: In the application server, from the list of applications open a desired application. In the list of devices, find a desired device and copy its Device EUI. The value of DEVEUI must be in the HEX format (`0x12, 0x34, 0x56, ...`). Once in HEX format, we need to supply the DEVEUI with LSB (least significant bit) first. Therefore we need to rewrite it to `..., 0x56, 0x34, 0x12`. In the sketch, paste its value to `PROGMEM DEVEUI`.
    - *APPKEY*: From the list of devices, pick a desired device. Open *Keys (OTAA)* tab, uncover the Application key and copy it in HEX Array format. In the sketch, paste its value to `PROGMEM APPKEY`.
  - Save the sketch
  - Load the sketch to Arduino.
  - Arduino joins the network and data can be seen on Chirpstack Application server under Applications/APPLICATION_NAME/Devices/DEVICE_NAME
